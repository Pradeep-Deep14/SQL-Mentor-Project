# SQL Mentor User Performance Analysis 

![SQL Data Analytics](https://github.com/Pradeep-Deep14/SQL-Mentor-Project/blob/main/Unknown-5.jpg)

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help beginners understand SQL querying and performance analysis using real-time data from SQL Mentor datasets. In this project, you will analyze user performance by creating and querying a table of user submissions. The goal is to solve a series of SQL problems to extract meaningful insights from user data.

## Objectives

- Learn how to use SQL for data analysis tasks such as aggregation, filtering, and ranking.
- Understand how to calculate and manipulate data in a real-world dataset.
- Gain hands-on experience with SQL functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `EXTRACT()`, and `DENSE_RANK()`.
- Develop skills for performance analysis using SQL by solving different types of data problems related to user performance.

## Project Level: Beginner

This project is designed for beginners who are familiar with the basics of SQL and want to learn how to handle real-world data analysis problems. You'll be working with a small dataset and writing SQL queries to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.

## SQL Mentor User Performance Dataset

The dataset consists of information about user submissions for an online learning platform. Each submission includes:
- **User ID**
- **Question ID**
- **Points Earned**
- **Submission Timestamp**
- **Username**

This data allows you to analyze user performance in terms of correct and incorrect submissions, total points earned, and daily/weekly activity.

## SQL Problems and Questions

Here are the SQL problems that you will solve as part of this project:

### Q1. List All Distinct Users and Their Stats
- **Description**: Return the user name, total submissions, and total points earned by each user.
- **Expected Output**: A list of users with their submission count and total points.

### Q2. Calculate the Daily Average Points for Each User
- **Description**: For each day, calculate the average points earned by each user.
- **Expected Output**: A report showing the average points per user for each day.

### Q3. Find the Top 3 Users with the Most Correct Submissions for Each Day
- **Description**: Identify the top 3 users with the most correct submissions for each day.
- **Expected Output**: A list of users and their correct submissions, ranked daily.

### Q4. Find the Top 5 Users with the Highest Number of Incorrect Submissions
- **Description**: Identify the top 5 users with the highest number of incorrect submissions.
- **Expected Output**: A list of users with the count of incorrect submissions.

### Q5. Find the Top 10 Performers for Each Week
- **Description**: Identify the top 10 users with the highest total points earned each week.
- **Expected Output**: A report showing the top 10 users ranked by total points per week.

## Key SQL Concepts Covered

- **Aggregation**: Using `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG` to aggregate data.
- **Date Functions**: Using `EXTRACT()` and `TO_CHAR()` for manipulating dates.
- **Conditional Aggregation**: Using `CASE WHEN` to handle positive and negative submissions.
- **Ranking**: Using `DENSE_RANK()` to rank users based on their performance.
- **Group By**: Aggregating results by groups (e.g., by user, by day, by week).

## SQL Queries Solutions

Below are the solutions for each question in this project:

### Q1: List All Distinct Users and Their Stats
```sql
SELECT USERNAME,
       COUNT(ID) AS TOTAL_SUBMISSIONS,
       SUM(POINTS)AS POINTS_EARNED
FROM USER_SUBMISSIONS
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

### Q2: Calculate the Daily Average Points for Each User
```sql
SELECT TO_CHAR(SUBMITTED_AT , 'DD-MM') AS DAY,
	   USERNAME,
	   AVG(POINTS) AS AVERAGE_POINTS
FROM USER_SUBMISSIONS
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 2;
```

### Q3: Find the Top 3 Users with the Most Correct Submissions for Each Day
```sql
WITH DAILY_SUBMISSIONS AS
(SELECT 
       TO_CHAR(SUBMITTED_AT , 'DD-MM') AS DAILY,
	   USERNAME,
      SUM(CASE
			WHEN POINTS > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0
	   END) AS CORRECT_SUBMISSIONS
FROM USER_SUBMISSIONS
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2
),
USERS_RANK AS
(
	SELECT DAILY,
	       USERNAME,
	       CORRECT_SUBMISSIONS,
	       DENSE_RANK()OVER(PARTITION BY DAILY ORDER BY CORRECT_SUBMISSIONS DESC) AS RANK
	FROM DAILY_SUBMISSIONS
)
SELECT DAILY,
       USERNAME,
       CORRECT_SUBMISSIONS
FROM USERS_RANK
WHERE RANK <=3
```

### Q4: Find the Top 5 Users with the Highest Number of Incorrect Submissions
```sql
SELECT USERNAME,
       SUM(CASE WHEN POINTS < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)AS INCORRECT_SUBMISSIONS,
       SUM(CASE WHEN POINTS > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)AS CORRECT_SUBMISSIONS,
	   SUM(CASE WHEN POINTS < 0 THEN POINTS ELSE 0 END)AS INCORRECT_SUBMISSIONS_POINTS,
       SUM(CASE WHEN POINTS > 0 THEN POINTS ELSE 0 END)AS CORRECT_SUBMISSIONS_POINTS,
       SUM(POINTS) AS POINTS_EARNED
FROM USER_SUBMISSIONS
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

### Q5: Find the Top 10 Performers for Each Week
```sql
SELECT * FROM
(
SELECT 
       EXTRACT(WEEK FROM SUBMITTED_AT)AS WEEK_NO,
       USERNAME,
       SUM(POINTS)AS TOTAL_POINTS_EARNED,
       DENSE_RANK()OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(WEEK FROM SUBMITTED_AT) ORDER BY SUM(POINTS) DESC)AS RANK
FROM USER_SUBMISSIONS
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 1,2 DESC
)
WHERE RANK <=10
```

## Conclusion

This project provides an excellent opportunity for beginners to apply their SQL knowledge to solve practical data problems. By working through these SQL queries, you'll gain hands-on experience with data aggregation, ranking, date manipulation, and conditional logic.
